# codes-in-tool-release
This is the official github repository for the [screening-tool](https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/) developed by LEAP lab, IISc. The repository contains codes for the classifier development, statistical analysis of the classifier results and the bias and fairness analysis for various subgroups of the population.

**To get the BLSTM classifier results**:
1. Clone this repo `codes-in-tool-release`.
2. Seperately, download and extract the [Coswara dataset](https://github.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Data).
3. Make sure to put `Coswara-Data` folder generated from step 2 inside `/home/data/`.
4. Verify that `classifier_BLSTM_model/data/<audio-cat>/dev.scp` paths are now consistent in your local machine.
5. Enter the folder `classifier_BLSTM_model` inside `codes-in-tool-release`.
6. In terminal, run `./prpare_feats.sh` for all the 9 audio categories: `breathing-deep`, `breathing-shallow`, `cough-heavy`, `cough-shallow`, `vowel-a`, `vowel-e`, `vowel-o`, `counting-normal`, `counting-fast`.
6. Type `./run.sh` in your terminal and ENTER. Once done, you can find the results inside `results` folder.

**To get the transformer classifier results**:

Follow the steps described in **To get the BLSTM classifier results** after replacing `classifier_BLSTM_model` by `classifier_transformer_model` in steps 4 and 5.

**To get the logistic regression, random forest, multi-layer perceptron classifiers results**:

After following steps 1,2,3 from **To get the BLSTM classifier results**,
1. Verify that `classifier_LR_RF_MLP_models/data/<audio-cat>/all.scp` paths are now consistent in your local machine.
2. Inside the folder `classifier_LR_RF_MLP_models`, run `./run.sh` in Terminal. It runs for a specific `<audio-cat>` (e.g. `cough-heavy`). Any of the 9 audio categories can be set at `audiocategory` field at the top of `run.sh`.

**To perform non-uniform fusion of 9 audio modalities and/or symptom data**:

1. Run `fuse_modalities_v2.ipynb` with appropriate `rootdir`, `res_folder` and other paths.

**To get the bias and fairness analysis results**:
1. Go to `bias_analysis.py`.
2. `work_dir` should be set to path where bias analysis results are to be saved.
3. `csv_metadata_path`, `test1_path`, `test2_path` and `gnd_truth_path` may be set based on the classifier model to be analyzed for bias and fairness.
4. Run `python bias_analysis.py` from Terminal.
5. It computes the AUC for different subgroups in test set and associated p-value based on two-sided Mannâ€“Whitney U statistical test.

**To get the 95% confidence interval on classifiers AUC results based on bootstrap replicates**:


Run the `bootstrap_sampling_CI_v2.py` in `statistics/bootstrap_sampling_CI` with appropriate arguments. Sample command: `python bootstrap_sampling_CI_v2.py -s 1000 -n test1_test2_scores.txt -l /home/debarpanb/verisk_dicova2/DICOVA/icml_workshop_covid_19/srikanth_e140522_transformer/data/test1_test2 -m AUC -c 95 -i /home/debarpanb/coswara_final_project/coswara_validation_study/e120422_debottam_26.4.22/results/breathing-shallow`

**To get details about gender, age, demographics and other factors for the dataset used**:

`dataset_analysis.ipynb` computes number of samples in the dataset corresponding to subgroups based on age, gender, demographics etc. and different COVID and non-COVID subgroups.
